Sample Question Paper
=======================

Q.1>
Write a C++ program to print all natural numbers in reverse (from n to 1).
but with one constraint i,e if number is multiple of 5 then ignore it.
example:
n=12
output: 12 11 9 8 7 6 4 3 2 1

Q.2>
WAP to create a class Time having data member 
 hour and minutes,
 member function.
 1)constructor
 2)use operator overloading (+) to add 2 time
   example:
        1st object value : 3 hours 50 mins
        2nd object value : 2 hours 20 mins
        output           : 6 hours 10 mins       
 3)convert_into_minute()  
    example:  2 hours 20 mins  -> 140 mins
        
Q.3>
Write the definition of a class METROPOLIS in C++ with following description : 
4   Private Members   – 
MCode  //Data member for Code (an integer)    
MName  //Data member for Name (a string)   
MPop  //Data member for Population (a int)   
Area  //Data member for Area Coverage (a double)   
PopDens //Data member for Population Density 
CalDen() //A member function to calculate (PopDens = MPop/Area) 

Public Members   – Enter() 
A function to allow user to enter values of 
Mcode,MName,MPop,Area and call CalDen() function  
ViewALL() A function to display all the data members 
also display a message “Highly Populated Area”  if the Density is more than 12000 

Q.4>
WritethedefinitionofafunctionFixPay(floatPay[], intN) inC++,whichshouldmodifyeachelement
 of thearrayPayhavingNelements,asper thefollowing              
rules: Existing Value of Pay Pay to be changed to If less than 100000 Add 25% in the existing value 
If >=100000 and <20000 Add 20% in the existing value 
If >=200000 Add 15% in the existing value 


                                          OR

Write a user-defined function AddEnd4(int A[],int Size) in C++ to
find and display the sum of all the values, which are ending with 4 (i.e., unit
place is 4).
For example if the content of array is:
int ar[4]={24 ,16 ,14,10};

output:48


Q.5>
WAP to draw a pattern 

*******

*******
*  
*
*******


Q.6>
WAP to demonstrate a exception handling with the help of array 
Arr of size 5 , 
int Arr[5]={23,44,5,6,7};
if user want to display  a particular number with the help of indexing
he can ,but if we enter index which is greater then the highest index ,
thrown an exception.

Q.7>WAP to create a function in which u have to pass a string parameter if
string is palindrome return true otherwise return false
